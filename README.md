# ‚úàÔ∏è Predicting Flight Delays Using Classification Techniques

This project focuses on predicting whether a flight will be delayed using classification algorithms such as **Logistic Regression** and **XGBoost (Gradient Boosting)**. The dataset includes flight schedules, routes, and other attributes to help build a predictive model.

## üìä Exploratory Data Analysis

We began with a thorough EDA to understand patterns in delays across airlines and routes.

### üõ¨ Which flight has the most delays?

## üìå Key Insights

* Flights with **no delay** are far more common than delayed ones, creating a class imbalance challenge.
* **Logistic Regression** performed reasonably but struggled with recall for delayed flights.
* **XGBoost** improved performance slightly, especially in identifying delayed flights, though recall remains low due to class imbalance.
